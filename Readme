The first version of a Facebook Open Graph Library for Ruby. Require HTTParty to function.

For documentation on the Open Graph Library, see: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api

======================================
Quick Start:
======================================

* create a token by following the instructions at http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/desktop

The important part is to make a request to https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=...&redirect_uri=http://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html&type=user_agent&display=popup

(they have typos in the tutorial)

grab the result and copy the access_token parameter. This will need to be URL decoded.

With the decoded access_token, create a new Ogli client:

in the ogli directory, run
irb -Ilib

require "rubygems"
require "init"
client = Ogli::Client.new("your_access_token")

You can now fetch users with the client, for example:

myself  = client.user("me")

or

mikemangino = client.user("12451752")

When you fetch yourself, you can look at your posts and other information:

myself.posts

Unfortunately, quite a bit of information is unavailable due to a facebook bug. If you want to see this fixed, please vote for: http://bugs.developers.facebook.com/show_bug.cgi?id=9864

Contributing
========================================

1) fork the repo
2) Add tests for a missing method, such as client.post(post_id)
3) implement missing method
4) send me a pull request.

Feel free to add missing associations if you see them as well. My goal is to get a readonly API in place first, and then move on to the read/write API
